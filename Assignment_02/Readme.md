# DATA-690 Assignment_02
#### Here in this assignment we have to take pass 10 integers into a list, if we pass any string it has to raise an exception like retry and enter integer only. They are some conditions which we have to follow:
- We should not use any built-in libraries of Python like numpy, scipy or statistics.
- We have to use loops, try/except, break/continue, input() and int() function like these we have to apply for our program.
- To find maximum, minimum, range.
- To calculate mean, variance and Standard deviation.

> First we have to create a .ipynb file
> Then pass integers into list through iteration for given range
> Checks whether passed input is input/not; if it is ok then breaks loop and appends into list else it will raise an exception in form of error message like retry
> Later we have to convert the string list into int type of list
> At last we have to perform operations on that list like finding maximum, minimum, range and calculates mean, variance and standard deviation.
