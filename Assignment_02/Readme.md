# DATA-690 Assignment_02
#### Here in this assignment we have to take pass 10 integers into a list, if we pass any string it has to raise an exception like retry and enter integer only. They are some conditions which we have to follow:
- We should not use any built-in libraries of Python like numpy, scipy or statistics.
- We have to use loops, try/except, break/continue, input() and int() function like these we have to apply for our program.
- To find maximum, minimum, range.
- To calculate mean, variance and Standard deviation.

1. First we have to create a .ipynb file
2. Then pass integers into list through iteration for given range
3. Checks whether passed input is input/not; if it is ok then breaks loop and appends into list else it will raise an exception in form of error message like retry
4. Later we have to convert the string list into int type of list
5. At last we have to perform operations on that list like finding maximum, minimum, range and calculates mean, variance and standard deviation.
