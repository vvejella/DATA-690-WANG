# Python language basics 
#### Python Interpreter - 
1. Python is an interpreted language. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time. 
we can run it by executing the following command (the hello_world.py file must be in your current working terminal directory): 
                       $ python hello_world.py 
2. We can execute arbitrary Python statements by typing them in and pressing Return (or Enter). When we type just a variable into IPython, it renders a string representa‐
tion of the object:
#### Running Jupyter notebook -
1. One of the major components of the Jupyter project is the notebook, a type of interactive document for code, text (with or without markup), data visualizations, and other
output.
2. To create a new notebook, click the New button and select the “Python 3”. If this is our first time,try clicking on the empty code “cell” and entering a line of Python code. Then press Shift-Enter to execute it.
3. When we save the notebook (see “Save and Checkpoint” under the notebook File menu), it creates a file with the extension .ipynb
#### Tab Completion -
-  Tab completion is found in many IDEs, While entering expressions in the shell, pressing the Tab key will search the namespace for any variables (objects,functions, etc.) 
1. For List we have some methods like:
b.append     b.count    b.insert  b.reverse
b.clear      b.extend   b.pop     b.sort
b.copy       b.index    b.remove
2. For Datetime module we have:
 datetime.<Tab>
datetime.date       datetime.MAXYEAR      datetime.timedelta
datetime.datetime   datetime.MINYEAR      datetime.timezone
datetime.datetime_CAPI   datetime.time    datetime.tzinfo
